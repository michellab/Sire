SIRE changelog
==============

devel branch:

    [2017.3.0] December 2017 - Added new PDB (PDB2), Mol2, Gro87, and CharmmPSF
               parsers, as well as a GroTop parser, all part of the new
               MoleculeParser framework. Updated all of the swap-based
               methods to use this.

               Removed the ViewsOfMol Python wrapper and now have the
               code automatically return the correct python object for
               the molecule (or part of molecule) that is returned from
               the system. This makes simple scripts easier to write.

               General bugfixes and optimisations, including fixing
               bugs with the way that PropertyMap worked, cleaning
               up to/from converters from python objects to automatic
               Property wrappers, and fixing Process so that it can
               redirect to stdout and that isRunning works without the
               user having to call "wait" first!

    [2017.2.0] September 2017 - The MoleculeParser framework has 
               been created to support reading and writing of molecules 
               in lots of different formats. The first set of formats 
               that have been completed are Amber Prmtop, Amber Rst7 
               and Amber Rst/Trj. The parsers work in parallel, with 
               file formats automatically detected by the parser, 
               e.g. system = MoleculeParser.read( "file.prm", "file.rst" ) 
               will automatically do the right thing.

               Improved automatic compilation on Arch linux. 

               Fixed temperature checking and general bugfixing for mbar code.

    [2017.1.0] April 20 2017 - First 2017 release. Included new
            parallel MoleculeParser code for reading molecules,
            and moved fully over to C++-14 style coding for new code.
            Included AVX-512 vectorisation for Intel KNL and can
            now successfully compile and run using GCC 5 and GCC 6,
            as well as Intel 2017 compilers and Clang.

    [2016.3.1] January 9 2017 - Minor patch release that fixes bugs:
        (1) Correctly sets MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET to 10.8 so executable works 
            on OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and above
        (2) Fixed a parsing bug in Parameter that prevented integer or float
            parameters from being passed to ligandswap, waterswap etc.
        (3) Fixed a small bug in MultiDouble that meant it lost precision when
            swapping individual values
        (4) Fixed a parsing bug in Parameter that meant that windows path names
            were not interpreted correctly
        (5) Fixed the build scripts so that they placed bundled libraries into
            bundled/lib rather than bundled/lib64 (affected SUSE-based distributions)

    [2016.3.0] December 22 2016 - Public release containing full LigandSwap. Uses
     new optimised forcefields for energy calculations, built on top of Intel Threaded
     Building Blocks for parallelisation. New code is significantly faster with better
     scaling.

    [2016.2.0] June 3 2016 - Semi-private release for the CCP-BioSim workshops. Included
     the first version of LigandSwap and general bug fixes

    [2016.1.0] April 29 2016 - Merge of Bristol and Edinburgh codes, moved to miniconda
     and clean packaging system, including OpenMM fully, added in nautilus, somd etc.,
     added optimised forcefields, added a proper unit testing suite.


    [OLD] Updated gradient compuation in openmmfreenergst to finite differece gradients
    Allow the computation of reduced perturbed energies in openmmfreenergst of all computed lambda values
    Separated minimization and equilibration from production run.
    Implemented mass repartitioning for hydrogens atoms to allow for larger integration timesteps
    Added nautilus scripts
