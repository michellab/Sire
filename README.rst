About
=====
`Sire <http://siremol.org>`__ is a free, open source, multiscale
molecular simulation framework, written to allow computational
modellers to quickly prototype and develop new algorithms for
molecular simulation and molecular design. Sire is written
as a collection of libraries, each of which contains self-contained
and robust C++/Python building blocks. These building blocks are
vectorised and thread-aware and can be streamed (saved/loaded)
to and from a version-controlled and tagged binary format,
thereby allowing them to be combined together easily to build
custom multi-processor molecular simulation applications.

For more information about how to use Sire, and about application
built with Sire, please `visit the Sire website <http://siremol.org>`__.

Installation
============

The easiest way to install Sire is using our `conda channel <https://anaconda.org/michellab/repo>`__.
To create a new environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n sire -c conda-forge -c michellab sire
    conda activate sire

To install the latest development version you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n sire-dev -c conda-forge -c michellab/label/dev sire
    conda activate sire-dev

If you find that Conda is particularly slow to install or upgrade,
then we advise using `mamba <https://github.com/TheSnakePit/mamba>`__:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge mamba

You can then replace all ``conda`` commands with ``mamba``, e.g.:

.. code-block:: bash

    mamba create -n sire -c conda-forge -c michellab sire

There are also many `pre-built binary packages <http://siremol.org/pages/binaries.html>`__,
which are available for Linux, Mac OS X and Windows, which are quick and easy to install.

However, as you are here, it is likely you want to download the latest,
greatest version of the code, which you will need to compile. To compile Sire,
you need a Git client to download the source, and a working internet connection
(needed by the Sire compilation scripts to download additional dependencies).

The easy install option is::

    git clone git@github.com:michellab/Sire.git
    cd Sire
    ./compile_sire.sh

A small word of warning, the compilation can easily take over an hour!

The above will download and install a new Miniconda Python installation,
into which Sire will be compiled and deployed (together with its
dependencies). This is by far the easiest way to compile and install Sire,
and is the route we strongly recommend. If you have any problems with
compiling and installing Sire, then please get in touch using the links below.

If you want to install Sire into an existing Miniconda or Anaconda
Python installation, please follow the instructions in `build/INSTALL_INTO_ANACONDA.rst <build/INSTALL_INTO_ANACONDA.rst>`__.

Bugs, Comments, Questions
-------------------------
For bug reports/sugguestions/complains please file an issue on
`GitHub <http://github.com/michellab/Sire/issues>`__.
or contact the developers via the google user group: `https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sire-users`

Developers guide
----------------
Please `visit the website <http://siremol.org>`__ for information on how to
develop applications using Sire.

GitHub actions
--------------
Since Sire is quite large, a build can take quite long and might not be neccessary
if a commit is only fixing a couple of typos. Simply add ``ci skip``
to your commit message and GitHub actions will not invoke an autobuild.

Note that every time you commit to devel, it will trigger a build of Sire,
full testing, construction of a Conda package and upload to our Anaconda
channel. Please think twice before committing directly to devel. You should
ideally be working in a _feature_ branch, and only commit to devel once you are
happy the code works on your branch. Use ``ci skip`` until you are happy that
you want to trigger a full build, test and deployment. This full pipeline will
take several hours to complete.

Have fun :-)
