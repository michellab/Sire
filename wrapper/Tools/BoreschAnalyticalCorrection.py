# Script to calculate the analytical correction for releasing Boresch
# restraints - see Equation 32 in J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 35, 9535â€“9551
# This includes the standard state correction and will be reliable when
# restraints are sufficiently strong, r is sufficiently far from zero,
# and r2, r1, l1, and r1, l1, l2 are sufficiently far from collinear. If
# this is not the case, the semi-analytical expression should be used.
