== Step 1 - Install anaconda/miniconda and the Sire corelib ==

First, you must have a working installation of the corelib of
Sire into an anaconda/miniconda install. Note that you only
need to go as far as installing the corelib. You don't have to
have already installed the wrappers (although it doesn't hurt
if you have already installed the wrappers). I am going to assume
that you have installed Sire into $HOME/sire.app. This means that
you should have a directory called $HOME/sire.app/pkgs/sire-[VERSION], 
e.g.

ls $HOME/sire.app/pkgs/sire-2015.0.0/bundled

should show 

bin     doc     include lib     mkspecs plugins share

If it does, then everything is ok.

== Step 2. Install gccxml ==

Next, you must install gccxml onto your computer. This can be 
installed via yum, e.g.

yum install gccxml

or

apt-get gccxml

If your distribution doesn't come with gccxml then you can
download it from here

<http://gccxml.github.io/HTML/Index.html>

via

git clone git://github.com/gccxml/gccxml.git

If you have had to download gccxml, then you will need to compile
it and install it according to the instructions contained in 
this distribution.

Once you have installed, test it by typing;

gccxml --help

If it works, then you should see some nice help text :-)

== Step 3. Install pygccxml ==

pygccxml is available from pip. Install it using;

$HOME/sire.app/bin/conda install pip
$HOME/sire.app/bin/pip install pygccxml

== Step 4. Install Py++ ==

Download Py++ from here

<https://bitbucket.org/ompl/pyplusplus/downloads>

e.g. <https://bitbucket.org/ompl/pyplusplus/downloads/pyplusplus-r1247.tgz>

Unpack this directory using

tar -zxvf pyplusplus-r1247.tgz

Then install it using

cd pyplusplus
$HOME/sire.app/bin/python setup.py build 
$HOME/sire.app/bin/python setup.py install

This should install everything.

== Step 5. Scan the list of Sire headers to wrap ==

Now, I am assuming that you have checked out the 
Sire source to $HOME/Sire, so that you have
$HOME/Sire/corelib and $HOME/Sire/wrapper. You need to scan
for changes in the wrappers using the command

cd $HOME/Sire/wrapper
$HOME/sire.app/bin/python AutoGenerate/scanheaders.py $HOME/Sire/corelib/src/libs .

This should complete quickly with no errors.

== Step 6. Autogenerate the wrappers for each module ==

For each module you want to regenerate, use the command

cd $HOME/Sire/wrapper/[MODULE]
$HOME/sire.app/bin/python ../AutoGenerate/create_wrappers.py

e.g. for the Mol module, you would type

cd $HOME/Sire/wrapper/Mol
$HOME/sire.app/bin/python ../AutoGenerate/create_wrappers.py

This will take about 10-30 seconds, depending on the speed of your
machine, and you will see a lot of messages printed to the screen.
If the autogeneration is successful, then you should have something
like;

file "AtomEditorBase.pypp.cpp" - updated( 0.000000 seconds )

(one line for each file that is updated. Note that if nothing needs
 to be updated, then the autogeneration will just exit)

NOTE - You cannot regenerate the wrappers for the Error or Qt modules.
       These contain hand-generated wrappers that cannot be changed.

NOTE - If you want to regenerate all of the wrappers, just run the 
       command $HOME/sire.app/bin/python create_all_wrappers.py
