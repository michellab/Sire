description = """
proteinswap is a method developed and implemented using Sire that allows relative binding free energies of a ligand to two different proteins to be calculated from first-principles, condensed-phase simulations. The method is currently under development and is not yet published (so use at your own risk!). The method is similar to waterswap, but instead of swapping a ligand between a protein box and water box, it instead swaps the ligand between two protein boxes.

The method works by constructing a reaction coordinate that swaps the ligand bound to one protein with a cluster of water that is bound to another protein. The affect is to unbind the ligand from one protein while simultaneously binding it to another.

The input files for a proteinswap calculation are the Amber format coordinate and topology files that represent the solvated protein0-ligand and protein1-ligand complexes (solvated using TIP3P water in a periodic, orthorhombic/cubic box).

Assuming that these files are called “complex0.crd” and “complex0.top”, and that the ligand is called “LIG0”, and “complex1.crd” and “complex1.top”, then the command to run a proteinswap simulation is;

sire.app/bin/proteinswap -c0 complex0.crd -t0 complex0.top -l LIG -c1 complex1.crd -t1 complex1.top

Sire will run the calculation using a default configuration that should be sufficient for most use cases. If you want to change any of the configuration parameters, then you can do so by writing a configuration file, the help for which can be found by running

sire.app/bin/proteinswap --help-config

Once you have written a configuration file, e.g. called “CONFIG”, then you can use it via

sire.app/bin/proteinswap -c0 complex0.crd -t0 complex0.top -l LIG0 -c1 complex1.crd -t1 complex1.top -C config

Sire will automatically use all of the processor cores available on your compute node. The calculation is not fast, and the free energy averages (collected simultaneously via thermodynamic integration (TI), free energy perturbation (FEP) and Bennetts Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method) will take 1-4 days of compute time to converge.

Sire performs the calculation as a series of iterations (1000 by default), with the binding free energy (and binding free energy components) written to an output results file at the end of each iteration. These files, called output/results_????.log (where X is the stage number and ???? is the iteration number) can be monitored during the simulation to check for convergence. At the end of the simulation, you can analyse the results using the Sire app analyse_freenrg, e.g.

sire.app/bin/analyse_freenrg -i output/freenrgs.s3 -o results.txt

This will calculate the potentials of mean force (PMFs) from the FEP, TI and BAR averages and will write them all to the files 'results.txt'. At the bottom of the results will be four estimates of the relative binding free energy. These four estimates are; estimate from analytic integration of TI, estimate from quadrature based integration of TI, estimate from FEP and estimate from BAR. The relative binding free energy is the average of the four estimates. An error can be approximated by looking at the spread of these values (e.g. by a standard deviation). If the simulation is well-converged, then these four estimates should be roughly equal.

In addition to the output/results_????.log files, Sire will also write a restart file (psrc_restart.s3) and will write all of the free energies into freenrgs_????.s3 files (for the total free energy, and also for the residue/water components and two protein parts). These .s3 files contain the streamed versions of the Sire objects, and can be used to restart the simulation, or to inspect the free energies or perform statistical analysis (e.g. recalculating the free energies using different integration methods, examining convergence of thermodynamic integration compared to free energy perturbation etc.). Also, Sire can be instructed to write out PDB coordinate files of the intermediates in the calculation, e.g. so you can see how each protein changes conformation as the ligand is exchanged with water. The PDB output files show only the atoms that move during the simulation, so do not worry if you only see a small cutout of your protein.

While proteinswap aims to calculate the relative binding free energy, it is not magic, and cannot overcome errors in the parameters or model of the complex. proteinswap will only be as accurate as the underlying model of the complex, and as it neglects terms such as polarisability, ionic effects and concentration effects. Care should be taken when interpreting the results of proteinswap, and, ideally, repeat calculations should be performed, e.g. by running on snapshots taken from an equilibrated molecular dynamics simulation.

If you need more help understanding or interpreting the results of a proteinswap calculation then please feel free to get in touch via the Sire users mailing list.
