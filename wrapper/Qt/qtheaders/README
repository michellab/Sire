This directory contains the Qt headers that are scanned to
generate the sire.legacy.Qt wrappers. These headers come
from the opensource X11 version of Qt 4.2.1

(the minimum version of Qt supported by Sire)

These headers are used *just* to generate the wrappers, as then
these wrappers should be source compatible with Qt >= 4.2.1

These are modified versions of the Qt 4.2.1 headers, modified to allow
easy generation of the boost::python wrappers.
