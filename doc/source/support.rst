How to ask for help
===================

We are really happy that you are using :mod:`sire`, and want
to do everything we can to help you if you have any problems.

We have limited resources, so please help us help you by
doing the following:

1. Check the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/sire/issues>`__
   page to see if anyone else is having a similar problem. Join the
   discussion there by either upvoting the issue, or posting
   your own experience. This will help us all, as a community,
   work together to share and help each other with our problems.

2. If your issue hasn't been posted, please double-check that
   there isn't anything in the :doc:`tutorial <tutorial/index>`
   or :doc:`API documentation <api/index>`, or anywhere
   else in this website that could help you.

3. If your problem is with the code, then please check that you are
   running the latest version of :mod:`sire`. We are continually working
   to fix bugs, so hopefully we have already fixed your problem in
   the newest release. Please install the newest release of :mod:`sire`
   (e.g. in a new conda environment) and check to see if you still
   experience your problem.

4. If you can't find help from any of the place mentioned above,
   then please create a new issue on our
   `GitHub issues page <https://github.com/OpenBioSim/sire/issues>`__
   that fully describes the problem. Please let us know the
   operating system you are using (e.g. Linux, MacOS or Windows),
   and confirm that you are using the latest release of :mod:`sire`.
   Please describe the problem in as much detail as you can.
   It helps if you can provide example input files or a small
   piece of code that can reproduce your issue. This will help us
   to create a unit test that reproduces your problem on our
   computers, so that we can then work on creating a fix.

Please remember to be respectful of everyone in the community,
and be patient. Be mindful of our
:doc:`code of conduct <code_of_conduct>`.
