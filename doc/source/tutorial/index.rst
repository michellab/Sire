This tutorial will take you through most aspects of running, understanding,
analysing and customising Sire. The tutorial is designed to be run
through in order.

This tutorial assumes that you have installed Sire following
:doc:`the instructions here <../install>`, and have activated
the Anaconda / miniconda Python environment into which Sire was
installed. You can test this by starting python and typing

>>> import sire as sr

If ``sire`` imports without error, then everything is working.

If you can't import ``sire``, or have any other problems, then
please :doc:`ask for support. <../support>`
