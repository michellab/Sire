===========================
Loading from multiple files
===========================

It is often the case that molecular information needs to be read from
multiple files, e.g. a separate topology and coordinate file.

You load from multiple files simply by passing multiple filenames and/or
URLs to :func:`sire.load`.

>>> mols = sr.load("https://siremol.org/m/ala.top",
...                "https://siremol.org/m/ala.crd")
Downloading from 'https://siremol.org/m/ala.top'...
Downloading from 'https://siremol.org/m/ala.crd'...

>>> print(mols)
System( name=ACE num_molecules=631 num_residues=633 num_atoms=1912 )

You can pass in the filenames as multiple arguments or as a list,
whichever you find easiest.

>>> mols = sr.load(["https://siremol.org/m/ala.top",
...                 "https://siremol.org/m/ala.crd"])

If the files or URLs have a common base, then you can save some typing
by using :func:`sire.expand`, e.g.

>>> mols = sr.load(sr.expand("https://siremol.org/m",
...                          "ala.top", "ala.crd"))

or

>>> mols = sr.load(sr.expand(sr.tutorial_url,
...                          ["ala.top", "ala.crd"]))

.. note::

   `sr.tutorial_url` expands to the base URL for tutorial files
   (https://siremol.org/m). It is worth using this variable for
   the tutorial as it auto-completes and will reduce errors.

If you are loading files, you can also make use of glob expressions
(wildcard expansions), e.g.

>>> mols = sr.load("ala.*")

.. note::

   This line loads the `ala.top` and `ala.crd` files that
   were downloaded by the above lines. This is because Sire downloads
   files at URLs to the current directory. You can tell it to use
   a different directory by passing that in via the `directory`
   argument, e.g. `sr.load(sr.expand(sr.tutorial_url,"cholesterol.sdf"), directory="tmp")`.
   The directory will be created automatically if it doesn't exist.
