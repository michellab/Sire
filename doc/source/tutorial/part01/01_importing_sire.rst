Importing sire
==============

Start a Python session (e.g. an interactive python console or a
Jupyter notebook).

You import ``sire`` by typing

>>> import sire

.. note::

   Note how this tutorial uses ``>>>`` to show a command that you should
   type into an interactive Python session, such as an ipython console or
   Jupyter notebook

As a convention, we will import the :mod:`sire` Python module under the alias
``sr`` to reduce the amount of typing. We will use ``sr`` throughout this tutorial to
mean :mod:`sire`.

>>> import sire as sr
