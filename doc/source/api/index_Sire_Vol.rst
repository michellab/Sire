Sire.Vol
========

This class provides classes used to define volumes or spaces, e.g.
periodic boxes or truncated octahedrons, and to then efficiently calculate
distances between points within those spaces. This module is rarely
used directly, but instead is used implicitly by higher-level
parts of Sire.
