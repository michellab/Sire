Sire.Squire
===========

This is an experimental module that provided interfaces to various
quantum chemical packages. This enabled Sire to use those programs
to calculate QM and QM/MM energies, so that QM and QM/MM simulations
could be performed.

.. warning::

   These classes have not been developed or used in a while. It
   is likely that the interfaces to the QM programs is now out
   of date. If you are interested in this functionality then
   please get in touch and we can work out how to
   resurrect this code.
