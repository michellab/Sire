Snag list
=========

Below is a series of snags with the code that we'd like to fix, but
currently lack the personpower to tackle now. If you'd like to
try and fix one of the below then get in touch with us by
`raising an issue <https://github.com/michellab/Sire/issues>`__,
or forking the repo and issuing a pull request when you are done.

Ideally let us know so that we can create a feature branch for your
work, so that no-one else duplicates your effort.
