# Containers

These containers are used to support Sire development.

* [sire-generate-wrappers](sire-generate-wrappers) - This container provides
   a full working environment that is used to generate the Python wrappers for Sire.
   Please use this container whenever you generate the wrappers, as this will ensure
   that wrapper generation is consistent, and only minimal changes will be committed.
   Full instructions on how to generate the wrappers 
   [are here](sire-generate-wrappers).
