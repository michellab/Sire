# This is a simple script that runs the minimum commands needed to 
# compile and install Sire, assuming it has already been successfully
# compiled and installed. This is useful to speed up development, 
# as you can run this script instead of `compile_sire.sh` in the 
# above directory.

# Only run this script if you know what you are doing ;-)
