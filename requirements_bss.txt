# BioSimSpace requirements. These aren't needed by Sire, but allow it to be
# built in a self-consistent way, i.e. so BioSimSpace can be installed on top
# of it. These will be added to the "host" section of Sire's requirements,
# hence Sire will be built in an environment in which they are already
# installed.

# Optional packages: These packages aren't required by BioSimSpace, but are
# commonly installed by users alongside it. Adding them here allows a
# user to create environments with and without these packages installed.

# The following are actual BioSimSpace run-time requirements. Please update
# this list as new requirements are added.
